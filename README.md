The Need:

The internet is flooded with educational video content, but its unstructured nature makes it difficult to find specific information and maximize learning. Traditional search methods often fail to capture the nuances within videos, leading viewers to waste time sifting through irrelevant parts.

Intelligent Search: Forget scouring long videos. Search for keywords, and the app highlights relevant sections in the transcripts, guiding you directly to the information you seek.
Enhanced Understanding: Gain deeper insights through summaries and key topics automatically extracted from the videos using AI.
Context-Aware Learning: Ask questions related to the video content, and the app utilizes a powerful AI model to provide answers with context, fostering a more interactive learning experience. (Future work: Interactive assessments will further solidify knowledge)
Benefits:

Save Time: Quickly find relevant information within videos, eliminating the need to watch everything.
Deeper Learning: Gain a more comprehensive understanding from summaries, highlighted keywords, and context-aware question answering.
Improved Efficiency: Streamline your learning process by focusing on the most valuable parts of each video.
